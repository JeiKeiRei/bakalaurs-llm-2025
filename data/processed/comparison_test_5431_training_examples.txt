# Training Examples for Depression Detection

These are examples of texts and their correct classifications:

Example 1:
Text: I had sent him a picture of my cat sitting on a windowsill by an open window. I was thinking about how I wish I wasn’t depressed and how I wanted to just kill myself, and he sent me a message that said “No don’t jump” but referring to the cat picture.
Classification: Depressed

Example 2:
Text: So depression sucks, it really does. The internal fighting of oneself, I’m just wanting it to stop. I’m not suicidal (this time) but other times it gets the better of me. This is the most candid I’ve ever been. I use to type long monologues into the google search bar of how I would like life to end, that would be the closest I come to speaking about my internal sadness. I would delete it along with my search history as I would hate for someone to view it and be concerned. This is a “throwaway” account I guess, but my reason for posting is not to say I’m sick and about to end it, but I’m hoping there are ways to help it. I can’t do this ‘train your brain’ crap or self help books. I’ve had numerous meds but lose sense of who I am. Is there a physical therapy, shock, sleep etc etc that can jolt you out of this mental rut?  I have my vision on psychedelic therapies, those look promising.

Any other possible helps?

Text: Hello i am a 12 year old dutch boy. I am the scilent smart kid in class that always get good grades butt also i am not the tipical nerd in class that doesnt do anything but learning no I am in 7th grade and I have a class that is called science but it what i do now is make anything over a bicicle to race with.(It is for the looks) I have a boy who also does that class and we are sort of friends. butt he makes comments like: "Sytse (my name), You ruined everything." I really dont like that sort of comments because i am soccially really unstable. I have been trough a lott the last couple of years because my little sister(3 years younger than me) was alway angry. That really effected me. Also other classmates will kick me and i know it is al yokes en stuff but i really dont like that and i haven't been happy for a long time. when i am home is it also always that i am really tired. The only things that give me energy are drawing alone locked up in my room and watching youtube wit h my earbuds in. it also doesnt help that my little sister is really adhd or something. i mean REALLY ADHD. it isnt normal. and i cant have any attention because she always has something my parents have to see. My parents are the best, dont get me wrong butt i really dont know what to do. also i havent shared this story to anyone ever. my parents tell me that i seem depressed. It hasnt been proved yet but i am just not happy all the time. Not in school, not at home. the only thing that gives me some sort of energy is drawing. i can do that all day long. 

well thanks for reading my story. i hope you can help me.

Ps: I am not super good at english.
Classification: Depressed

Example 4:
Text: Whenever I run into a friend I always try and be supportive and happy for them if they are doing well. I honestly am happy for them but when I stew over it for a while and just feel bad about my own situation.  I know everyone has there own challenges that I am not seeing, I just get to see the good side of their situation, but I can't help but feel shitty.    

I'm doing ok, but if I didn't have this fucking depression I know I'd be doing better. I can't make progress I've tried to force myself but that seems to just make things worse, I also don't have it that bad so I feel like I'm unrelatable. I also try and be as rational as I can but that doesn't help either it just makes me feel like I'm being sensitive and overreacting.
Classification: Depressed

Example 5:
Text: I just want to be happy. I haven’t been happy for the last four years. The last time I felt that sensation in my brain was my freshman year of college. I was talking to a girl and I could feel the dopamine in my head. That was the last time I felt happy. I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since. The friends have helped make me feel whole. When I’m alone I don’t know what do. I repressed these feelings for a long time. I started watching Bojack Horseman and the feelings came back. Am I a whole person? Am I took messed up too feel love again? I ask myself this every day. When I’m drunk I am able to let these feelings out. I don’t want to be dependent on alcohol to feel this way. I want to talk about my feelings, but I don’t want to be less of a man. Jessica has made me decently happy, but I still don’t feel this way. I don’t want to be dependant on her either. When I beat off I only can finish when I think about personal emotions. I can't even cry anymore. What does that mean? Am I better? I don’t have decency on alcohol. I have stopped for a while and I still feel this way. I don’t know if it is because I’m lonely or because of how messed up I am. When your mother tells you that you should have been a miscarriage you reevaluate life. At the age of thirteen. Is that really an age when you should be questioning your existence? I don’t want pity, I just want to feel normal. When I look at myself I question my life. I have accepted death, but I have also noticed the finite life you have. Once you live, you die. That is scary to me. I just want to cry, but even while writing this I can’t. There are people worse than me, but the way I think about it is, have wasted my life? College is full of life. I haven’t lived one. I wish I was dumb and could fade into the crowd, but I can’t. All I think about is my deathbed and how it won’t be anything. I die and that is it. I’m gone. In high school, I had the same thoughts, but my stepmom said that I’m young and I don’t understand. I find myself having the same thoughts. Maybe nonexistence is fine. I just want to lay in bed and drift away with my mind until I do die. I’m afraid of the loss of thought. Once you're gone your gone. Nothingness. I’m scared. I just want that feeling one more time, but how does happiness happen? Relationship, family, or accomplishment? The future scares me and I don’t want to sit here on shitty earth and have these feelings at fifty. How do people become happy? I’ve lost the feeling and don’t know how to get it back. Once we die that is it. Am I going to die and feel nothing? Is a relationship enough? Or am I broken? I almost want to pass away not think. What does it all mean? Are we just bacteria that evolved enough to think? I want answers, but nobody will tell me.
Classification: Suicidal

Example 6:
Text: Got to the point that the psych hotlines in my area all know me.
Classification: Depressed

Example 7:
Text: It makes me feel like I won't be able to find new friends in the future, because people see me as different, and they treat me in a more childish or condescending way.

How could I make my mom or psychologist understand? I don't want them to think I'm doing this to burden them or something like that...
Classification: Suicidal

Example 8:
Text: Nothing for me, nothing in me. 

No, it won't be tonight that I kill myself. But hopefully soon. 

I'm good at being useless and passively fucking my life up. By extension, leeching off the few that know and care for me. 

Maybe I'll die in my sleep tonight. I'd love that. 

This sounds pretty edgy. I used to feel edgy, now I don't feel. Not that I miss it.

Text: My workplace is on the 46th floor. In theory, suicide should be so easy.

Example 11:
Text: I’m not feeling great mentally right now, I know I should really just try to hold on for a little longer since I know it’ll get better but I’m just so tired and I just want to rest, you know? I’m finding it harder and harder to convince myself to eat and drink water. All I want to do is sleep. I feel terrible. I need help but I don’t know how to get it... I don’t want to put my parents through this again (I’ve attempted before a few times) and I just don’t know what to do.... high school is so hard right now and I feel like I can barely keep up while my peers seem to be doing so easily... I feel so sick and exhausted....

Text: That's the fun cycle if this community, is it not?

Prove me wrong guys.

Comment if you think so. Although, to be fair I do think r/depression has been helpful. It's dark, but also helps normalize shit.
Classification: Depressed

Example 13:
Text: Even when I’m around people I’m lonely. I feel crazy. I can’t stop looking back at my awful life, I must have such poor judgment
Classification: Depressed

Example 14:
Text: I’ve never been good at making friends. I never had any through middle school. Last year I made one though. We got really close but after I told him about my depression he seemed to drift off. Yesterday morning while we were talking he said he had to meet up with his teacher and told me that he’d tell me once he’s done. As I was walking around the halls I saw him with a group of other people. I don’t care that he was with others considering things have gotten awkward between us. what bothered me was that he just ditched me. I’d much rather have been told that he was going to meet some of his other friends. I dont have anyone tanymore because after that he just said that he doesn’t want to see me anymore.
Classification: Depressed

Example 15:
Text: Im a freshman in college. I feel terrible writing about all my problems on an online forum, but I’ve gotten to this point in my life where I just feel stuck and I feel like I can’t confide in my friends or family. I feel sad all the time. I don’t like myself and I don’t think I ever will, but what gets me to care about myself the most is when people show they care about me because it reminds me of what makes me happy. 

But lately I just feel like a burden to everyone. I recently told my close (best?) friend at college that I hate myself and that sometimes, even though I would never do anything to myself, I feel like there’s no point in me being here. She told me that she doesn’t want to hear stuff like that and that she’s going to distance herself because that made her worry about me all the time. And I understand and that I should be going to see a counselor but it just hurts. Because yea if my friend told me that I would worry but I also wouldn’t push them away because I would understand that they just need someone. 

It hurts that I put my whole heart into all my relationships and that I would do anything for the people I care about and to lift them up but at this point it feels like they wouldn’t do the same and I just feel alone. I feel like everyone is fed up with me and that I’m just sad and there’s so many things missing from my life and I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I try so hard to be this amazing friend and person to everyone around me and it gets me nowhere. I want to fix it but I don’t know how and now I’m just left feeling absolutely alone and with no one else to turn to. I just don’t know what to do
Classification: Depressed

Example 16:
Text: What to do when it doesn't matter if your happy or sad or miserable, loved etc just tired of living? Life is so mundane unintressing and time is relative to the one experiencing it so whether I grow old and die or kill my self makes no difference in the end. I know there's no after life and even if there was I would be fine in hell I would actually prefer it there. Just uninterested in participating in this world not for negative reasons more like boredom plus the fact I've always hated my parents for even creating me. Not like I don't enjoy things or have good memories more like cool I came and saw and now I'm bored and wish to move on and rest eternally. Any ideas on similar feelings. And before you tell me I have so much to live for and shit dont sell me that or the emotional side "think of the pain you will cause" not like it will actually matter once our sun dies and our planet stops existing my friendsand familywill all get over it and any pain I cause woulddisappear after their deaths. Emotions are petty and meaningless. Anyways just wondering how many of you feel this was and any idea on good ways to end it all. Been thinking about overdosing on heroin laced with fentanyl on a beach watching a sunset kinda my fantasy been dreaming of it for yrs.
Classification: Suicidal

Example 17:
Text: First off, I wanted to say to you all in the group, things do get better. With years of therapy and medication I feel like I'm on the path to healing. I was depressed as long as I can remember and it does get better, hang on. 

But, I'm doing so well I'm afraid the only reason I've started to actually love myself and feel happiness is because of my medication. I don't want to be medicated my entire life, I want to find ways to be happy and love myself without it, and I'm scared when I'm off of meds, I'll go back to the same me. Anyone have this experience? Any advice?
Classification: Depressed

Example 18:
Text: Just one or two every day, but I'm going through the list of important people. Don't know if I'll go through with it, but if I do I'd rather have some small form of closure for those close to me.
Classification: Suicidal

Example 19:
Text: My school always leaves the roof door unlocked and recently i’ve been thinking and wondering if its high enough.
I just can’t stand this life anymore because everything has been spiraling downhill like, me and my mom are on bad terms and she’s the only parental figure i have in my life. I also have very little connection to the world and in the end i’m just the root of everyone else’s problems. When my friends tell me they want to commit because of me i just say me too.Anyways, the only people i’d leave behind is the father i never knew. And plus my school is a hellhole so i feel it’d be best to go out where most of my problems started.
Classification: Suicidal

Example 20:
Text: I'm 17 years old and I feel suicidal for 5or 6 months. I think about killing my self nearly everyday but I don't have enough courage to do it. Every night before going to bed,I think to myself "I hope I can die this night." Is there anybody who feels the same as me?
Classification: Suicidal

Example 21:
Text: For context, I’m 19, in my first year of college, and for one month - since I failed one of my exams - I lost everything I thought I had. All my friends, my crush, and for a week now, my Dad, who just wants to be upset at me forever for not helping him to the end with carrying some construction material.

For one month, I’ve entered a downward spiral, amplified by events such as the rejection mentioned earlier, or not being able to give the license exam two days ago because of some stupid policemen who told me that I “didn’t pay the license tax” correctly. And not being able to make up with my Dad, who just hates me.

The final straw came an hour ago, when I got laughed at when I entered the classroom. Just because I happened to enter at the same time as some other older students who didn’t belong there.
When I left the college, no one noticed.

It is probably a matter of weeks or even days before I take my life. Nothing is worth it. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing can save me now. Nothing. And what’s more, no one (apart from probably my mother and sister) won’t miss me. But let’s be serious, they’ll live without me. And also, I’m sure no one will notice this post, in the heap of posts of people with more serious life issues. 

This is really what makes me a failure: not being able to live happily in a life which would seem ok to most people here.

So yeah.

Example 22:
Text: Yea. I’m ready for the “you’re just a kid”. Idgaf. I want to go. My mind and body is screaming for a way out of this fucking horrible mindset of myn. Im a dumbfucking stoner with a stepdad who literally makes me fear to go downstairs. I sit in my room all day and hope that I just fucking die. My mom Dosent fucking care jack shit about me. My step dad gets pissed off over nothing. And leaves for 8 months. And I swear by this saying those 8 months are the happiest months I ever have. My stepfather almost choked his father out when he was 16 and said he wishes he did it. Which makes me scared to say anything to him. My mother knows I don’t like him and don’t like being near him but she Dosent care. I was bullied for nearly my whole elementary school years and I was having suicidal thought from the start of grade 3 or 4. And that’s just not okay in the eyes of anybody. I currently just took 10 pills and hoping I black out. I have one friend. Who I made when I was forced to move back to my old house. Him and I bonded over stupid and racist shit. And now he’s like a brother to me. I wish he didn’t have to put up with my bullshit.  I love him like a brother and all. But I feel that he would get over it soon enough. I feel bad for people who have to deal with me. And I just want all this pain and suffering of my day to day to fucking end. I want me to end. I want everything to fucking end.

Example 24:
Text: Im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go. Apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place, im on mobile and im lost. Not real names, this is a throw away etc etc etc.
Okay so im 22 M I guess I've been dealing with depression for about 8 years. I have anxiety , I'm self conscious and I like to believe im more fucked up than I actually am and if it's okay here I'd like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where I am now to no one in particular.
I was never the popular kid. I was known but never popular. I was the kid that got picked last for sports or games, never got to play soccer with the other kids because I wasnt good enough, wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek, but I pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me. I got to play lego or slap jack, tic tac toe, you name it, I played by myself. I had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school (kindergarten-grade 3). Not knowing how to interact with the other kids I was lonely. I didnt realize I was lonely as it was well normal for me. The world was out to get me and I let it, I had no voice. I didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how I felt. I was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them. Interpret them. I know what they look like and how they feel but showing them? Using them? You'd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water. But this is how I was brought up and its what I knew. Life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and I had a fake image of what it was. Because of this I matured faster in other aspects of life. I grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them. Into worrying about what others think of me, always comparing myself to EVERYONE else, not just the best or the people above me but everyone. I felt like everyone hated me and thought I was some annoying kid so I shut myself off from the world. That's the first few years of life. I ran around as a "happy" lonely kid. As I grew up and was about 10 or 11 I learned to read people and guess what they were feeling/thinking, how their day was going n shit. I learned to feed off of everyone's emotions around me rather than feeling my own. I essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now I'm struggling with fixing it. I fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own, I imitated them and copied them to feel included. I grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole I felt, i buried it deep down and (as a green swamp friend of mine once said) I became an onion, I made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work. (Sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my Intention, fuck it let's continue) the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this, building my wall of fake emotions to "protect" everyone else from my greatest enemy... myself, I didnt trust myself to not fuck up, didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone. I lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside. It was repulsive and wrong but I didnt know that. I would say this is when I got my first taste of depression around the age of 12. Grades 5-7 I was the class runt/Guinne pig/doormat, I was the kid being bullied. The other kids unanimously decided I was the kid they picked on. Fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the TEACHERS  would pick on me. So I accepted "who I was" and that was the school fuck up. I tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride. Yea it worked for a bit as armor. I made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit. But grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and I became... the germ. These kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it. This was the tipping point for me. All my so called classmates and friends I had suddenly turned on me and I was alone. Truly alone, left half dead for the vultures to pick at. I broke. I broke into so many little pieces, all those people I grew up around people I trusted turned. I couldn't touch anyone with out them screaming "DONT TOUCH ME GERM" "GREAT THANKS NOW I HAVE TO WASH MYSELF" and other hurtful shit like that. They couldn't even sit in a chair I had used without washing it and sanitizing it. Okay I say I was alone but I had 2 friends, payton and dane, they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldn't back down. Half way thru the school year I attempted suicide. I had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing, I drew a little blood but it hurt to much so I stuck around. I had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like I asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher, it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close I was to not being here. So he told that I wasnt feeling good in my head, that I was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing. This teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal. Brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on. I played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end. I didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up. After he started to say something I broke, I told them almost everything. About me wanting to die, not wanting to live and how I wished everyone else would die first. I didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide. My worst fears had come true, I spoke up and now everyone hated me. They couldn't bully me but did they hate me. After the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts (yes I told them I had thoughts, no I didnt tell them I tried) I came back into the class room and I'm greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me. The first thing this kid told me (who I thought was one of the people that I had as an acquaintance) "You know OP fuck you, you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what? You want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way? Next time think before you speak". I can't tell you how much this affected me. That kid got sent home for the rest of the week. This is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right? No those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ, kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before. Grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6. Aging more and more I hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations. Elementary school behind me and moving to middle school I made new friends, a new chapter in life. Friendsthat didnt judge, one guy even had the same name as me "mysteriouslyreddited". I started to notice girls at this point too. Two girls in particular, quinn and Anna. Quinn is a couple years younger than I had been babysat by my mother and I by her mother, they switched out as they both worked. And she, well Quinn's amazing, pretty no beautiful, shes got these eyes that just, her hair... wow. And her smile (._. ) just everything. She was my first crush although quickly forgotten (we went to different schools. You know out of sight out of mind. K not like that but I hadn't seen her in a while). Anna on the other had, well I can describe her similarly, but things were different with anna. They were. Easier??? Its. Well she was the girl I fell head over heels for and she knew it. We talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be. I continued on the same way I did in elementary school, by wearing armor and growing my onion. Anna and I stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys. I got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly, I Introduced her to a couple guys I knew she was crushing on and I enjoyed watching her be with them (as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own. Bad idea 0/10 would recommend.) And well this went as well as you may guess, it went great. WRONG. I was confused and shut off, shut down and shot down. I don't remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months. It became personal for the both of us. I told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die, words were said damage was done and I thought I was okay with it. I learned quickly that I in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and I was bare, everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other. I was having more and more suicidal thoughts. I had spiraled to my lowest point that I've ever been, self harm, alchohol, skipping school, it was the worst part of my life. Highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it?? Its not oof my bad. I was skipping school, fighting with my mothers husband, smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze. The fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me, yes I felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good I felt for her. I cut everyday for over 2 years. I didnt know what to do, the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me. My entire depressive episode was brought on because I couldn't stand up for myself or tell myself it's okay or when to stop. I lost myself, lost my armor, lost everything. Or at least I thought I lost everything when in reality I was only just discovering life. I became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others. I became a robot. I woke up late went to school skipped all my classes, went home played COD or skyrim and went to bed. Rinse repeat and that's how I lived from day to day, month to month, for a couple years. I still haven't reconnected with anna (anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories. I like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know that's false). As I lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained. Being brought up as a christian I was told to believe in god, that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help. I called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer, if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us? My grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare I speak about god in that manor. After mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how I hadn't been on one in years and I'd like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away. It was spring break and they were leaving next weekend. I inquired if I could go with them and because of my grades I was told no. I told them if they let me go I'd pick up the pace in school and i would try, but only if they let me go. Well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing I know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled I am and that Id be lucky to consider even going. Me being the teen I was I yelled back. Fuck yous were exchanged. My grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me, no fucking chance gramps not in my current state. We had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses, he litterally ripped my shirt off me, ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor. He got up and started to yell "get the fuck out of here, you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out!!!!". I replied with "well then I guess it wasnt nice knowing you. When you're ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are" and left without looking back. He did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line. That night after we made up and got a blizzard I went home to find my mother's husband fuming because of how I talked to my mother which cause a fight with him. That was the night I lost my home, my family, he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage. Even tho that was one of my lowest points I didnt see it as a loss. Yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what I want when I want. So I started working on myself. I moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh. While I did climb out of my depressing hole I have yet to beat depression. I got a great girlfriend and living large now adays . Started some anti depressants, counseling and what not. Well now Im gonna skip ahead to why I wanted to get some baggage off my back. A few weeks ago I went out to the bar with some friends and I ran into none other than quinn. I'd had some pregame drinks, had some drinks while I was there. I didnt eat anything that day, was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds. So I was already drunk, feeling great, I'd seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so I just smiled and "ignored" her. Well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her. I mean if you were me you'd find it impossible to. So I did what any drunk man does, i had a shot and approached her, asked if I could buy her a drink and  From what I remember we hit it off. I had a blast but tbh I was not looking for anything in her I just remembe how I used to feel but more Importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years. I was.. no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there. So we were talking, and I looked at her and time just seemed to stop. We talked but I don't remember what it was about. At one point I asked if I could kiss her. My self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep. There is so much that I wish I could remember about that night but I cant. I dont know what happened what I said or did. This is the hardest I've had to fight this depression in a long time and this time I'm worried that I won't be able to win. I don't recognize who I am anymore. I dont like this person I've become. I love my GF but I feel like I'm going to drag her down and make her depressed like me. I feel like I'm not good enough for her and I'm hurting her by being with her. I cant stop thinking about quinn but I think I fucked up even trying to be friends with her. There was a small spark there but nothing major besides I dont want there to be a spark right now, I've talked to my GF and she knows I have feelings for another. It was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows that im struggling with my feelings and that I'm not looking for a way to leave her. I've been on the verge of relapsing and going back to self harm. Im not crossing that line because when I do there's no turning back. Im tired of being depressed and I want out but he hardest part is figuring out who i am and if I can keep all my current bridges or if I have to go out and build new bridges. Im gonna keep trudging on and finding my way thru this fucked up place we call earth. Again im sorry this was so long and all over the place, if you read it thanks for listening, if you skip over this story thanks for not wasting your time (that came out wrong but ov well). I'm not looking for help I just need to talk to someone. I am doing okay I just had so much pent up I needed a release. Next therapy session will hopefully straighten up my current state of mind
Classification: Depressed

Example 25:
Text: ...but never actually have enough energy or courage to do it.
At least not yet.
Classification: Suicidal

Example 26:
Text: I'm 16 and I have had frequent thoughts about dieing and killing myself. I think of new ways of doing it like cutting and hanging and stuff and have cut my self a lot. I have had a rough childhood and recently something awful happened to me. I am lucky because I have supportive friends and family but I still feel empty and lonely. I might just do it soon...
Classification: Suicidal

Example 27:
Text: I think about suicide most days. When I visit my 92yr old grandmother in her care home I wish I could be there, waiting to die - how peaceful it must be to know you will be released from all this suffering very soon? 

I consider myself a spiritual person and have been heavily into yoga, meditation and psychedelics and learnt about Buddhist philosophy which is what has formed my beliefs about death. Most people find this a healing path but for me the transcendental experiences I have had have felt like such a homecoming that I haven’t wanted to return to reality. I have never felt at home in myself and often feel like I desperately want to “get out of my body” in which I feel trapped. I have always felt I was born into the wrong body/life. I’ve also believed from a young age that I will die from suicide or a reckless accident. I unsuccessfully attempted age 25 and have had some other near misses. 

The thing I am struggling with is I believe that if I kill myself my soul will return back to the source but I am worried it will be turned around and put right back into another life of equal amount of suffering to mine as my soul won’t have evolved at all. I don’t think I can escape it unless I evolve by overcoming my struggles. I’ve had an eating disorder for 17yrs, as well as BPD and Bipolar. I guess this is the cycle of Samsara and the continual dukkha/suffering which is part of the human condition. 

When I think about this it makes me feel trapped and is going some way to put me off the idea of suicide, but at the same time I feel like I’ve exhausted my energy to try and overcome it all in this life - I’m exhausted in my battle against this ED, it feels completely hopeless.  Perhaps if reincarnation does happen at least I could try overcoming some other set of struggles? 
Hoping reincarnation is not a thing and our souls return to the source and don’t have to come back here again for more of this bullshit!
Classification: Suicidal

Example 28:
Text: Honestly, I'm really happy about it. It wasn't a very bad relationship, I just couldn't handle being in it. But I'm feeling a lot better then I ever have. It was definitely a good thing for me and I'm actually glad it happened.
Classification: Suicidal

Example 29:
Text: I'm aware of why I'm doing it. I hate my life right now, and I am scared of the future. The past is a warm safe blanket full of photos, videos, and messages to remind me of what used to be, and the people who used to be in it. I hate getting older. I want to reach out to some of these old friends from 10 years ago. Is it even worth it? They've all moved on, but I haven't. I don't want to delete these memories, but I feel like I have to at this point. Any other suggestions?
Classification: Depressed

Example 30:
Text: I've been in a very relaxed relationship since September but ever since january things have been "on the wall." During winter break, especially after the holidays, she became a lil bit distant to me. We eventually talked and she wanted to be apart for awhile due to personal issues with herself and I understood and we went from a relationship to just best friends. We have talked about her issues before so I told her I will always be there for her and she insisted she didnt want things to change or grow apart. We were in a very adult relationship so I didn't want to ruin or friendship, we eventually became close and things were all the same as they were before we broke up. Lately though she has been going through things again and I am having a hard time getting through it this time. Last time I took it very mature and was actually the only relationship I have actually not completely fallen apart after the break up. This time I'm thinking it's just me though and my own low self esteem has caused issues more than anything. I barely get a text from her and we never get to hang out and it really hurts, more than anything I have every felt before. This has resulted in me doing things I have never done before that I feel ashamed of, caused me to take up nicotine again, and major other issues resulting in my school work in college to be a burden rather than something to help me. Sorry I just needed to get some stuff off my chest and things and I hope she never sees any of this. She is an absolute gem and I want to be the one to be there for her as much as I can but I feel like she is hiding from me at times and doesnt want to even deal with me anymore. The only part that give me hope and joy is when I see her in class and we talk and joke, and then I kiss her good bye and I dont see her for another few days. It's just alot of pain to see someone I care about so much just dissapear from my life like this. Or atleast it feels that way if I'm not over thinking it. Sorry guys!
