I have a truck, an apartment to myself, a cat, and a decently paying job (I'm surviving, ha). I just feel so goddamn lonely.

T025,"Okay, here it goes. I don’t really care if this isn’t a throwaway account, it’s whatever.

During the beginning of my teenage years, (13) I didn’t care about anything, how i looked, or anything of that sort. Looking in mirrors was fine, and life was good.

When i hit 14 i sent a really horrible selfie of myself to a group of online friends, was bullied really bad for it, and so on. From then on i’ve been incredibly alert of myself, if you know what i mean. 

I stayed with this friend group because they were the only people i knew and could talk to, my parents hated me for being gay, and my brothers only took in their footsteps. After this, i just completely broke down, got so insecure that i wore a jacket for a year because i was so scared of anyone seeing me. That ended when i was 14. 

I stopped because i just decided to stop feeling sorry for myself and that i was the only problem in that situation. Since then, it’s only gotten worse. I now spend all time i can get in my room, under a blanket, won’t call anyone because i don’t want anyone to hear how bad i sound, don’t let anyone see me because of how bad i look, etc. 

I’ve attempted suicide once, and that one time my dad walked in on me trying to hang myself. I’ve given it lots of thought since then, and honestly, every day it feels like a better option.

T026,"I mean yes never feeling happiness, always feeling tired, and all that other shit that comes with depression would've contributed to this, but I think I'm just using depression as an excuse to hide the fact that I'm a terrible person.

I've had depression since at least the age of 10. I'm 17 now and until about a year or two ago my depression was never a huge problem. I was passing school, I had friends and I had hobbies. But one day after my suicide attempt I got a random boost in motivation, and I felt happiness for the first time in years. Feeling happiness only made me realize how miserable I am all the time, which led to me figuring out that I have depression.

Ever since I became aware of this, I started doing things like, failing school, ghosting friends, and dropping out of hobbies. Whenever I smile or laugh, I hide it and try my best to make myself sad. I fetishized my sadness, sadness was my happy place, and being happy was painful for me. I feel like I'm just putting on a play for myself to hide the fact that I'm just a selfish ass, who does nothing but play videogames all day. Now here's a good confession, I don't have a suicide attempt, yeah when the the day came I was to lazy to get out of bed and walk to the railway so I just didn't. Yet everyone I've told my story to has heard me talk about my suicide attempt, I told myself this so much that I actually forgot I never even tried for a while, but it's all a lie, just an excuse to make me look more broken then I already am. Some days I think of actually going there, and reenacting that moment to see if I'll actually do it or not, but I'm to lazy to get out of bed so as if I'd do that.

I fear that my therapist will find out. That if I get cured from my depression that I'm still going to be just as shitty as always and that it was just me all along. If that's true then that means there's no curing me, and that I'm just going to be like this forever.",Suicidal

I have seen my only friend go through drug addiction and drug related psychosis. I have seen how life can shit all over you. 

My depression started at an early age because of bullying and lack of friends. Except the one in my life currently, you can't destroy our relationship. I feel like my depression really kicked in when I was around 15 or 16. My friend moved away to another city and I was left all alone. At the time bullying got worse and I made a few acquaintances but no real close friends. When I was 17 I dropped out of school and moved out of my family home. I started to have panic attacks in the shower and that was when I turned to drugs to numb the pain. Xanax was my go to for sedation as I could fight the effects somehow I loved that. Iv been a daily cannabis smoker for most of the time since I was 16 except the times I ran out and couldn't get anymore. I have done lots of psychedelics (u could call me a psychonaut) any sort of alternate reality really. Cannabis helps motivate me to stuff. 

I'm currently 19, still a virgin and struggling with financial situations. I  only just earn enough money every week to cover my bills so I never really buy anything for myself except weed. I can never seem to get ahead of my depression. It's like it just keeps dragging me down.

I’m 23. Live in my parents basement with an amazing girl that I really don’t deserve. Most of my life I’ve been the quiet kid. Most people were scared of me in school because of that, but I’m too much of a pussy to actually do anything. Only reason anyone would talk to me was because I played football and went to school with most of my team. 

From elementary school through middle school I was really fucking ugly. Acne was terrible, huge fucking nose, no confidence. Had like 2 encounters with girls during this time period and I was a hardcore “nice guy.” Those 2 encounters were enough for everyone to realize I’m pretty fucking retarded. So most people avoided me. High school I peaked. (and by peak I really don’t mean much. Just the time that I wasn’t absolutely pathetic) Met the girl I’m with now, got in really good shape and did pretty good in football. Managed to get fucking C’s all throughout though so I got no scholarship for college. 

After high school my parents were amazing enough to pay for my college. 5000 fucking dollars a semester for me to do average my first semester then fail calculus my second semester. After my second semester I let my father convince me that I should go to school closer to home and do electrical engineering. First semester I did average. Next semester I failed fucking Chemistry and lab. Semester after that I failed my chemistry lab again so I had to switch to Computer engineering. Semester after that I failed Pde’s. Pretty much every semester after that I’ve failed classes. Not because I’m not learning the material but because I’m so fucking lazy I don’t do half the homework. Usually my homework grades suck but my test scores are good but not good enough to keep me from failing. Every year my parents keep telling me that they are going to make me move out and pay for my own school, but they keep giving me more chances and I keep royal fucking those chances. Honestly don’t understand why they give me so many chances. 

Anyways, this year isn’t any different. Last semester I took 3 fucking classes (9 credit hours) and failed all three of my classes. Worst I’ve ever done. So this current semester I’m retaking 2 of the 3 I failed and just had to withdraw from one of them and the other I will probably get a C in. I don’t get it. I have a part time job at fucking Chili’s, I live at home, have everything going for me; don’t have to worry about expenses, amazing girlfriend, family that loves me. Yet I can’t fucking pass two fucking classes.

I’m a failure. Honestly no other explanation. I get to tell my mother that after this semester I am dropping out and moving out, therefore waisting 50,000$ of her money. Thing is, if I can’t pass two fucking classes how the fuck an I suppose to live on my own. Other thing is, I wouldn’t be on my own, my girlfriend would be with me which makes everything worse because I would be dragging her down with me. So instead of moving out I have decided I should probably just kill myself. I’ve planned it out for the most part. I have a 30-06 in my room that guarantees my death, I’ve scouted a place out where no one will be able to find my corpse. I haven’t written my goodbye letter because I’m honestly too pathetic to write one and probably won’t even leave one, I plan on depositing all of my money into an account that my girlfriend has access to so she can get out of this house as quickly as possible if need be, etc...

I know my death will negatively impact those closest too me but I’m almost positive my parents will get over it. Honestly my father has given up on me so I don’t think he’ll care much. My grandparents will be devastated but they will get over it.
Only one I’m worried about is my girlfriend. She’s about to start a new job right when I plan on killing myself and I don’t want to ruin that. I’m sure I can figure something out.

At the same time. I really don’t want to die. It still breaks my heart that I have to leave everything behind. My family has two amazing dogs that I would die for, I managed to go out with a girl way out of my league for 5 years that’s about to get a job relevant to her dream career, I have grandparents, aunts, and uncles that all seem to like me, etc...

Guess I’ll just bring a couple bottles to try and get over that heartbreak so I can pull the trigger.

Anyways, sorry to start my own fucking pity party. It was just hurting me to not say or write anything before I die since I’ve done relatively good at hiding my depression from everyone.

T042,"I was doing so good, the birds all sang in the morning, the aroma of the flowers; I had not been enticed by that smell in such a long time. I had managed to clean my room; got rid of the giant stack of clothes, the water bottle collection and opened up the curtains to let the sun radiate my small lumpy mattress. Lost 5 pounds in 2 weeks from eating right and hitting the gym. Went out of my way to interact with people, like I used to love. I was planning to make a cheesecake with my niece and make strawberry flowers. Then I realized how pointless all THIS is. I’m NEVER going to be happy. I guess that’s just how it goes. Like a swing, bro. Now I’m here indecisive on whether to buy the poison that has released me from the shackles of existence countless other times or return to my prison cell and “face it like a man”. Either way there is no way out.",Depressed
T043,"Sometimes I just cant even. I hate school so much, I hate everything about it. I hate all kinds of work too, I’m so fucking tired of all off it, having to work hard and try all the time and its still fucking useless, I still cant do jack shit and I’m a completely useless piece of human garbage. I hate life I wanna fucking die seriously",Depressed
T044,"I’ve had suicidal thoughts for a very long time. I’ve seen my GP, been put on meds, I’ve been to counselling you name it I’ve tried. But apart of me just feels like I’ve had enough and the only option is just to end my life. Sounds dramatic and selfish but if I’m honest I just feel like I have nobody there for me anymore and I’m just disappointing people around me like my parents for example, I know deep down that I’m just a failure in their eyes and all I’m doing is prolonging more upset for them as I’ve made there lives difficult in certain aspects with my depression and constantly making them worry. But I also feel as tho if I end it then there wouldn’t be that worry I’d then be gone. if I speak to my friends about it they’ll just turn around and say man up or stop being soft. Which has now just caused me to believe that I don’t have anyone there close to me to talk to, feel like Cant rely on anyone anymore and I just would be better off dead. Me and my ex split 6 months ago a short term relationship but that was one thing I felt really happy about and that ended because of how I am, just sad and perhaps not all there, or perhaps I’m just not capable in being in a relationship as there’s just clearly something wrong with me. I don’t see myself moving on from her to another as it shattered me deeply and I just can’t seem to want to get back out there, I just don’t believe I’m that type of person for anyone like she was at the time. Many things I could add to the list like I’m mid 20s I only have a part time job and I don’t feel motivated or want to look for a career because I just don’t feel I’m good enough anymore. Feels as though I’m really done with life and that my times is up and I don’t really know what to do anymore. I’m just sad and existing in a world that I don’t want to be apart of anymore and I’m typing this really because I don’t know who else to talk to about it anymore. I just want to crawl in a ball and cry every day and I wake up and go to sleep thinking I want to be dead. I just wish I could be happy again and be myself but it just doesn’t feel an option anymore..",Suicidal
T045,"For the longest time, I couldn't see myself living past 25. This mostly came about towards the last year of University and got worse around the end of 2017, when I wasn't landing work. 

In 2018, I met someone and suddenly I felt alive again. I felt calm and collected. Although I was stuck in the same loop of applying for work, it didn't feel as tiresome. In 2019, I got accepted into medicine and moved overseas. My partner starts tearing us apart 3 weeks into my move... I drop out of med school because the stresses from the break up became way too much to handle. Especially since I was overseas.

Now I am back to applying for jobs in my old degree and getting nowhere. I am heavily depressed. I can't see myself past 25 again. I have this strong feeling I will die this year. 

Atm, I welcome death with open hands... I am tired of life constantly shifting on me. :'(",Depressed

T047,"So I’ve suffered some heavy depression for a long time, my ex that I absolutely loved to the max just got along so well, she was so gorgeous, caring, loving and nice. She was the first girl I actually loved in a long long time. Me and her were so good for each other I thought. She knew I was suffering from depression but the crazy part is every day I was with her I was improving. She was the support I used to slowly walk up the steps to getting better. I was happy as can be to have a girl like that and for myself to climb out of that depressed hole I was in for so long. Well we got into an argument before our breakup because I thought we were being pretty distant and she blew up. She told me “I just can’t handle it anymore” and left me, I was heartbroken. She couldn’t handle my depression anymore and that’s what hurt the most. I loved her with my whole heart and now she looks at me like I’m some stranger on the streets. She never truly explained to me why everything happened and she won’t talk to me at all now. I thought I was making us stronger by opening up to her and having her help me but she never told me how much I was hurting her with my depression. She saw me improve so much and deciding to leave outta no where made no sense to me. Well here we are today, all that progress lost. I feel worse than I ever have in my life. It really fucking hurts to know the one person I loved most couldn’t handle me at my worst and left me to rot. I don’t even know what to do. I’ve deadass just been hooking up with girls at parties and drinking with my friends until I blackout. I don’t know if I can trust another girl with any of my emotions again or even trust myself to love someone again. I just wanted to give her the world but I ruined it for her and us. I’m a piece of shit I know, but i just want her to see that I was improving and for her to come back.",Depressed
T048,"Me : 21yo french garbage
My parents made me go to engineering school, far from their home in paris, after 3 years of preparatory in maths and physics . I immediatly hated the school, i  did a few entreprise visit with my class and i knew i didnt want to be an engineer. I d rather kill myself than becoming one engislave. I made really good friends in this city tho, even if i wasn't going to school anymore  at one point i was still very happy because of them.

So i told my parents i wanted to stop engineering school, that i wanted to get a job until next year when i will go study something i always dreamt about, becoming a doctor. I went back home for holidays, 3 weeks ago.

I have rough background story with my parents, i'm always in conflict with them and until last summer they always solved conflicts by hitting me or insulting me, saying horrible things that made me hate them. They did make me sleep outside for a few days when i was still a good student in preparatory class, they made me bleed several times, my dad with a sharped stick of wood and my mom with her nails.

I told them i wanted to get a job in the city i was studying, far from home, because i could be near my friends. I told them being home with them was torture, that it was making me go insane and suicidal. I'm still at their home rn, i have a job, but i still want to go live in this city, with my friends and my girlfriend who lives there and to get a job there. Nobody talks to me at home, they took my computer and my credit card. I cant go out, i cant see any friend nearby, i cant do anything or enjoy life. 

They want me stay here, no discussion possible. They make me want to kill myself, they repeating every time i talk about my friends that they don't care about me, that they think i'm a looser and  a piece of shit because i stopped this school.

I want to go to this city next week, but i dont have my appartment anymore. I don't know how to convince them to pay the rent for just one month, the time for me to get a job and be independent.",Suicidal
